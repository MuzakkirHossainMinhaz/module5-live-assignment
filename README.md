**Obtained Marks:** 100%

## Assignment Details

Create a Dart list named fruits with at least three fruits, represented as maps.

### Requirements

-   Write a function `displayFruitDetails()` that takes the fruits list as a parameter and prints out the details of each fruit.
-   Implement a function `applyPriceDiscount()` that takes the fruits list and a discount percentage as parameters. This function should update the price of each fruit by applying the discount.

#### Sample I/O:

-   Original Fruit Details before Discount:

    ```dart
    Name: Apple, Color: Red, Price: $2.5
    Name: Banana, Color: Yellow, Price: $1.0
    Name: Grapes, Color: Purple, Price: $3.0
    ```

-   Fruit Details After Applying 10% Discount:

    ```dart
    Name: Apple, Color: Red, Price: $2.25
    Name: Banana, Color: Yellow, Price: $0.9
    Name: Grapes, Color: Purple, Price: $2.7
    ```
